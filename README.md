# 🌍 World Data Analysis and Visualization

This project presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of countries around the world using a dataset containing information such as population, GNP, life expectancy, continent, and independence year.  
Through **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** visualizations, this analysis explores the relationships between key indicators of global development.
